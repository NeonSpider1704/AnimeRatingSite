# AnimeRatingSite
Repository for COMP-2084G Assignments where I will be creating an anime rating/list site

I have added a carousel in the home index.cshtml file. It was from the bootstrap documentations and was unsure if i needed to declare it.

The purpose of the applications is to add animes to a database that helps to keep track of ratings, genres and description to further help collect thoughts about the animes.
